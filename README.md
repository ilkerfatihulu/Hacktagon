🛡️ KidneyGuard
Track. Care. Live.

KidneyGuard is an AI-powered hydration tracking application designed to help users maintain optimal kidney health. Inspired by personal experience and driven by a mission to raise awareness, KidneyGuard turns simple hydration data into actionable health insights.

🌟 Inspiration
This project is more than just code. After losing my grandfather to kidney disease, I realized how vital early tracking and consistent hydration are for long-term health. I created KidneyGuard to empower people with the tools they need to build healthy habits and proactively care for their kidneys.
